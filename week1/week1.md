# Final Project: Glass Computing

## Project Concepts
*Project Material:* Glass  
*Project Description:* This final project will demonstrate the transparency, brilliance, and flexibility of glass for computing. Namely, we use glass substrates to build phonotic-like circuits and run various types of simulations that can be viewed from a liquid interface (which will employ Glassmorphism) from any modern web browser.

## Types of Glass
* Antique
* "Double-strength" (Annealed)
* Tempered (Safety Glass)
* Laminated (Plastic-mediated)
* Impact (Plastic-mediated++)
* Insulated (IGU)
