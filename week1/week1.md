# Final Project: Glass Computing

*Project Description:* This final project will demonstrate the transparency, brilliance, and flexibility of glass for computational process. Namely, we use glass substrates to build phonotic-like circuits and run various types of simulations that can be viewed from a liquid interface (which will employ Glassmorphism), as well as, any modern web browser. From bits and atoms to web pages.

Harmonic Oscillators (Harmonic Hopfield Networks)
Compression -> Crystals -> Crystal Intelligence -> Intelligence
